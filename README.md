## A cultural note

Dante Alighieri (c. 1265 – 1321), was a major Italian poet of
the Late Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called Comedìa and
later christened Divina by Boccaccio, is widely considered the greatest
literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of
world literature.
